# IOT - Data Visualizer

## Description

This website is a data visualizer for all my IOT devices. The purpose of this website is to display all the collected data in a nice and easy to read way. 

The website is heavily based on the Chart.js library to create the graphs. All the data gets fetched via a REST API from my Backend. 

The data is stored in a MongoDB database.
